A simple rust program to play monochrome video in a terminal.
Works nice with "bad apple" btw.

If you use GNU plus Linux you may also try to use the install script to create a release build and install it to `~/.local/bin/asciiplayer`

asciiplayer play <filename>
asciiplayer render <filename> <rows>,<cols>

```
