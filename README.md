# asciiplayer

A simple rust program to play monochrome video in a terminal.
Works nice with "bad apple" btw.

## Usage

Use `cargo` (rust's package manager) to build, the first argument decides what file to play.
If you use GNU plus Linux you may also try to use the install script to create a release build and install it to `~/.local/bin/asciiplayer`
